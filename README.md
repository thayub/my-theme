underscores-bootstrap
=====================

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a starting theme I hope to use when starting new WordPress projects.

This project uses node, grunt
=======
This project is piggy backing off Automattic's underscores project. I inserted Bootstrap 3 into the theme and enqueued the scripts in the theme's functions.php.

If you cd into the theme directory, you can run grunt to concat all the JS files together, compile LESS, and then minify all of these things. Have fun!
